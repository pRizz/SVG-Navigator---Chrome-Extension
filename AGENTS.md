# Bright Builds Rules

`AGENTS.md` is the entrypoint for repo-local instructions, not the complete Bright Builds Rules specification.

This managed block is owned upstream by `bright-builds-rules`. If this block needs a fix, open an upstream PR or issue instead of editing the managed text in a downstream repo. Keep downstream-specific instructions outside this managed block.

Before plan, review, implementation, or audit work:

1. Read the repo-local instructions in `AGENTS.md`, including any `## Repo-Local Guidance` section and any instructions outside this managed block.
1. Read `AGENTS.bright-builds.md`.
1. Read `standards-overrides.md` when present.
1. Read the local managed standards pages under `standards/` relevant to the task.
1. If you have not done that yet, stop and load those sources before continuing.

Use this routing map when deciding what to load next:

- For repo-specific commands, prerequisites, generated-file ownership, CI-only suites, or recurring workflow facts, use the local `AGENTS.md`, especially `## Repo-Local Guidance`.
- For the Bright Builds default workflow and high-signal cross-cutting rules used in most tasks, use `AGENTS.bright-builds.md`.
- For deliberate repo-specific exceptions to the Bright Builds defaults, use `standards-overrides.md`.
- To choose the right managed standards page, start with the local Bright Builds entrypoint `standards/index.md`.
- For business-logic structure, domain modeling, and functional-core versus imperative-shell decisions, use the managed standards page `standards/core/architecture.md`.
- For control flow, naming, function/file size, and readability rules, use the managed standards page `standards/core/code-shape.md`.
- For frontend visual defaults, theme defaults, and dark-mode decisions, use the managed standards page `standards/core/frontend-ui.md`.
- For sync, bootstrap, and pre-commit verification rules, use the managed standards page `standards/core/verification.md`.
- For the managed starter checks, run `bun scripts/bright-builds-check.ts all`; use its `--help` output for check-specific commands, exact-file exceptions, and trailing-slash `file-lengths` directory exceptions.
- For unit-test expectations, use the managed standards page `standards/core/testing.md`.
- For Rust or TypeScript/JavaScript-specific rules, use the matching managed standards page under `standards/languages/`.
- For TypeScript/JavaScript frontend framework and UI-library defaults, use `standards/languages/typescript-javascript.md`.
- Keep recurring repo-specific workflow facts, commands, and links in a `## Repo-Local Guidance` section elsewhere in this file.
- Record deliberate repo-specific exceptions and override decisions in `standards-overrides.md`.
- If instructions elsewhere in `AGENTS.md` conflict with `AGENTS.bright-builds.md`, follow the repo-local instructions and treat them as an explicit local exception.
